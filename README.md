This repository contains the most recent version of the manuscript for the Willcox, et al, 2016 paper [Type Ia Supernova Explosions from Hybrid Carbon-Oxygen-Neon White Dwarf Progenitors](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...832...13W)

Additionally, the scripts used to setup Flash for the deflagration-to-detonation transition simulations of the C-O and C-O-Ne models investigated in this paper are provided in `flash-setup-scripts`.

The directory `flash-run-scripts` contains scripts useful for running these simulations on a workstation or cluster.
